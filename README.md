If you're using CMake, you can include instructions for building your project here. For example:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
Note: move json files to build folder
This assumes that you are in the project's root directory.

## Usage
Once the Medicare project has been successfully built, you can run it using the following command:

```bash
./build/Medicare.exe
```
this assumes that Medicare is in a build folder. Change `build/` to whatever folder you have it from

# JSON files

The Medicare project uses JSON files for saving and loading data. Please ensure that these JSON files are located in the same directory as the executable (Medicare.exe) when running the program.
